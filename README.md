# Repository information
In this lab we have developed an interactive story with 3 scenes. It has been developed in html, using the A-Frame framework.

[Here](https://youtu.be/DdxIi-PO9j8) you find a demonstration video.

### Story concept
The idea of the first two scenes is to present situations in which we see the amount of stimuli and distractions that we are constantly receiving in our daily lives (advertising, multimedia, etc.), while in the last one we find a new space with different videos that make us reflect.

### Instructions
Download the project and run the first scene from a local server. For example, you can install the *atom-live-server-plus* package from Atom and run it from there.

To move in the environment use the WASD keys and to move the view, the mouse. To interact with objects, center the view cursor on the target for a few seconds.
